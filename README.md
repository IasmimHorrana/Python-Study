# Python-Study
Hello everyone! How are you doing? üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I'm creating this README to document my studies in Python for several important reasons:

1. **Recording and Tracking:** It's a great way to record my progress and keep track of what I'm learning over time.
  
2. **Sharing:** By making my progress public in a GitHub repository, I'm sharing my learning journey with others. This can be helpful not only for me but also for others who are learning Python or interested in following a similar path.
  
3. **Portfolio:** Having a dedicated GitHub repository for my studies serves as an online portfolio where I can showcase my skills and projects to potential employers, recruiters, and colleagues.
  
4. **Feedback:** I'm open to receiving valuable feedback from other developers, which can help me improve my skills and problem-solving approaches.

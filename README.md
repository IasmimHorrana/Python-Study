### <center> Hello everyone! How are you doing? üôã‚Äç‚ôÄ </center>
##### <center> _I'm creating this README to document my studies in Python for several important such as:_ </center>


* **Recording and Tracking:** It's a great way to record my progress and keep track of what I'm learning over time.
* **Sharing:** By making my progress public in a GitHub repository, I'm sharing my learning journey with others. This can be helpful not only for me but also for others who are learning Python or interested in following a similar path.
* **Portfolio:** Having a dedicated GitHub repository for my studies serves as an online portfolio where I can showcase my skills and projects to potential employers, recruiters, and colleagues.
* **Feedback:** I'm open to receiving valuable feedback from other developers, which can help me improve my skills and problem-solving approaches.

####   <center> We start learning the best way: </center>

- The _**print**_ function prints the specified message to the screen.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
- Create _**comments**_ using **#**

```python
# Comments help explain the logic behind a given piece of code.
print("Hello, github!")
```

- Types of _**Variables**_ in Python 

1. **Int:** Is a type composed of whole numeric characters.<br/>
2. **Float:** Type composed of decimal numeric characters.<br/>
3. **String:** A collection of alphabets, words or other characters.<br/>
4. **Boolean:** Logical data type that can take only two values: false or true
5. **List:** A data structure that is a mutable, ordered sequence of elements.

```python
# Example of an integer variable
age = 30
print("My age is", age)
```
In this example, the age variable is of type integer **(int)** and stores the value 30. This variable is used to represent a person's age. When printing the phrase "My age is", followed by the value of the variable

```python
# Example of a floating-point variable
price = 49.99
print("The price of the product is", price, "dollars")
```
In this example, the variable price is of the floating-point type (float) and stores the value 19.99. This variable is used to represent the price of a product.

```python
# Example of a string variable
name = "Iasmim"
print("Hello, my name is", name)
```
In this example, the variable name is of the **string type (str)** and stores the value "Iasmim". This variable is used to represent a person's name. (The text _string_ is always enclosed in quotation marks.)

```python
# Example of a boolean variable
is_raining = True
print("Is it raining today?", is_raining)
``` 
In this example, the variable is_raining is of the **boolean type (bool) and stores the value True.** This variable is used to represent whether it is raining today. 

```python
# Example of a list variable
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("The numbers are:", numbers)
```
In this example, the variable numbers is a list containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Lists are denoted by square brackets [ ], and elements inside the list are separated by commas. When printing the phrase "The numbers are:", followed by the value of the variable numbers, the program will display "The numbers are: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]".

- #### Mathematical Operations in Python:

1. Addition -> +
2. Subtraction -> -
3. Division -> /
4. Multiplication -> *
5. Mod (remainder of division) -> % 

```python
#Addition
print(3 + 5)

#Subtraction
print(5 - 3)

#Division
print(5 / 3)

#Multiplication
print(5 * 3)

#mod (remainder of the 5 by 3 division)
print(5 % 3)
```
```python
8
2
1.6666666666666667
15
2
```
- #### Basic String Operations

1. Concatenate -> +
2. Check if the text is contained within the other -> in

```python
#Concatenate
print('my salary is' + '2000')

#Check if one text is inside another
print('@' in 'horranaiasmim@gmail.com')
```
```
my salary is 2000
True
```
- #### Variable

variable = value

```python
turnover = 1500
cost = 800
profit = revenue - cost
print(billing)
print(profit)
```
```
1500
700
```

- #### Get User information

variable = input('Text for User')

```python
##to register a customer
cpf = input('Enter your cpf (only numbers, no dots and dashes)')
print('O cpf do cliente √© ' + cpf)
print('The customer's CPF is ' + CPF)
```
